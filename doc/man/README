The files in this directory tree are nroff source using the -man macro
set.  During "make install", they are processed into text output and
this output is placed in the binary distribution.

Because there is not an acceptable open source nroff command (groff
is a bloated C++ program, and Plan 9's is not open source), this approach
was adopted so that the installed VSTa system could display man pages
without requiring the presence of an nroff.  If you want to process
man pages for yourself, you will need to go get access to the Plan 9
source (it's pretty easy to get), after which you may contact me
directly to get the patches I applied in porting to VSTa.

I would welcome pointers to a pure C, small and efficient implementation
of nroff which was available under a suitable open source license.
