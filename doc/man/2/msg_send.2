.TH MSG_SEND 2
.SH NAME
msg_send \- send messages to a server's port
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/msg.h>
.br
.B int msg_send(port_t port, struct msg *msg);
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I msg_send()
queues a message containing zero or more message buffers to
the server connected to
.I port,
which must have previously been opened by a successful
call to
.I msg_connect().
By convention, the
.I m_arg
field of the
.I msg
contains the number of bytes contained in the message.
.I m_nseg
specifies how many segments of memory are being sent.  The
actual segments are filled into the
.I m_seg[]
array.
.PP
.I msg_send()
blocks until the server has received the message and
completed it via
.I msg_reply(), msg_err(),
or by terminating.
.PP
The treatment of the described segments of memory is determined by
the
.B M_READ
bit in the
.I m_op
field of the message.  If this bit is clear, the requested operation
is to send the described memory to the server.  If set, the server
does not receive the memory, and the server's reply will be filled
into the message segments.
.PP
The return value will either be -1, indicating an error, or the
number of bytes transferred.
