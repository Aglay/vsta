(Notes to Andy on each release)

Things to do per release:

1. Make sure /vsta/doc/features.txt is up to date
2. Check copyright year in /vsta/readme and /vsta/etc/motd
3. Edit /vsta/etc/banner
4. "changed", followed by "changed -r | grep -vw '[oa]'"
5. "cd /vsta/src" and "sh mkall", followed (if OK) by "sh mkall install"
6. Reboot and verify things still work
7. "cd /vsta", mount something on /dist, and "make -f mkdist.mk"
8. Put the install packages on my test machine and do a scratch install
9. Push it out to the FTP server
10. See if there are any new packages, and put links in the WWW page
11. "cd /vsta", and "rcsdo rcs -N<rel>:"
	<rel> is formatted as V1_6_4 (for 1.6.4, duh)
12. Update the release note page on the web site
