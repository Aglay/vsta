3. Edit vsta/etc/banner
4. cvs -n update 2>&1 | more
5. "cd vsta/src" and "sh mkall.sh"
6. "cd vsta ; sh mkall.sh install"
7. Reboot and verify things still work
8. "cd vsta/src" and "sh mkall.sh clobber"
9. "cd vsta", mount something on /dist, and "make -f mkdist.mk"
10. Put the install packages on my test machine and do a scratch install
11. Push it out to the FTP server
12. See if there are any new packages, and put links in the WWW page
13. "cd vsta", and "cvs tag <rel>"
	<rel> is formatted as V1_6_4 (for 1.6.4, duh)

	release announcement
