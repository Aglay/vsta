NAME

clone - create new distinct client connection copied from old
.sp
.bd 1
SYNOPSIS
.br
.in +6
.li 3
#include <sys/syscall.h>

int clone(port_t port);
.sp 1

DESCRIPTION
.br
.in +6
.ul 1
clone()
creates a new connection to the server currently serving
.ul 1
port.
After a successful
.ul 1
clone,
the client will have a new connection, whose initial
file position, access rights, etcetera, reflect those of
the original
.ul 1
port.
However, future changes to position and such will be unique
to each
.ul 1
port_t,
as no connection exists after the completion of the
.ul 1
clone.

NOTES
.br
.in +6
The
.ul 1
clone()
system call resembles much more the POSIX treatment
of file descriptors in a
.ul 1
fork()
than the semantics of a POSIX
.ul 1
dup().
