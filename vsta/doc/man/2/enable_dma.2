NAME

.ti +6
enable_dma - enable DMA abilities for current process
.sp
.bd 1
SYNOPSIS
.br
.in +6
.li 3
#include <sys/syscall.h>

int enable_dma(int channel);
.sp 1
.in -6
.bd 1
DESCRIPTION
.br
.in +6
The
.ul 1
enable_dma()
system call
changes the behavior of the kernel to permit a server
to operate in a DMA mode.  In particular, the process
is permitted to use the
.ul 1
page_wire()
and
.ul 1
page_release()
system calls, and messages received using
.ul 1
msg_receive()
are mapped into a DMA server's address space
as writable pages, thus permitting programmed I/O
directly into a client's memory.
.sp
.in -6
.bd 1
NOTES
.br
.in +6
This call is generally useful only to DMA-based I/O servers,
although certain transaction-oriented direct I/O filesystems
might benefit.
.sp
The argument is the DMA channel to be used by a hardware
DMA server.  On architectures where there is no concept of
DMA channels, it may be passed as 0.  On the x86, this argument
is currently unused.
