 *
 * PIPE is a VM-based FIFO buffer manager.  Its usual use is to open
 * /pipe/# (or wherever you mount the pipe manager) and receive a
 * new pipe.  Alternatively, /pipe/<number> will access an existing
 * pipe.  A pipe's "number" is its inum, from rstat().
 *
 * Internally, the pipe's "number" is simply its storage address.
