Make sure directory entries are not honored in EXTSIZ-allocated
	storage at end of dir file.

Make sure on file expansion that we don't read in the new space
	from disk.

Add a "first sector dirty" flag so we don't have to flush the first
	full extent just to update fs_file
	In fact, add interface of dirtying a range.  Allows for a
	bitmap in the future.

Directory block allocation is stupid--it will always be maximally
	fragmented.  Perhaps use a power-of-two progression when
	allocating extents?  Certainly can't use the default file
	allocation algorithm--the usage pattern is too different.

Ensure deletion of a directory can't happen unless it's empty.
