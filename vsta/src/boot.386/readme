The code in this directory is historical.  VSTa now boots using
GRUB, complying with the Multiboot standard.  The code here was
used to bootload VSTa from a loader running as a DOS real mode
application.  It no longer works, since VSTa is now organized
to be loaded above the 1 meg boundary.

In some future release, this directory will go away.

For now, you can use RCS to take a look at the old source files.
One step closer to deleting this....
