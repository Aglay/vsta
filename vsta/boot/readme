This directory previously held a boot loader "boot.exe" which ran from under
DOS and used the "boot.lst" configuration file.  VSTa is now Multiboot
compliant, and the preferred boot loader is "GRUB" (GRand Unified
Bootloader).  It now just contains the source controlled files which are
installed into /vsta/boot.  /vsta/boot also contains a kernel usable from
GRUB, as well as the other server executables needed to boot VSTa.  See
vsta/doc/roadmap.txt for more details on configuring GRUB with VSTa.

Once you have read about GRUB, the menu.lst file provided in this directory
provides some useful examples of how to set up GRUB to boot various
operating systems, including VSTa.
