# root=           (hd0,1)
# makeactive
# chainloader=    /boot/chain.os2

# For booting VSTa
#  The "modules=" statements below configure the booting system

title=          VSTa boot
root=           (hd0,0)
kernel=         /vsta/boot/vsta

# The modules used to boot
# If you edit these, be sure to refer to "VSTa debug" below, where
#  you must edit them again.

# The console driver
# cons -color		(default)
# or cons -mono		- For MGA text screen location
module= /vsta/boot/cons

# The name to port # mapper
module= /vsta/boot/namer

# The WD (ST-506 & IDE) driver
#
# Very likely you will not have to change this.  The default here
# is "readp", which reads the parameters from the IDE interface.
#
module= /vsta/boot/wd d0:readp
# or wd d0:cmos		- For CMOS parameter setup
# wd d0:cmos d1:cmos	- For two drives
# wd d0:cmos d1:readp	-  ...any combination, as needed
#		- D0 from CMOS, D1 from controller
# wd d0:<cyls>:<heads>:<sec/track>
#		- Manual setup; hand-specify the parameters

# Adaptec 1542b/c SCSI disk support
# You will almost certainly also want to read ../src/srv/mach/scsi/readme
# module= /vsta/boot/cam

# The swap driver.  It handles management of multiple swap partitions.
# Uncomment this only if you have taken care of setting up the VSTa
# swapping feature.
#
# module= /vsta/boot/swap

# The first DOS filesystem
module= /vsta/boot/dos -p disk/wd:wd0_dos0 fs/root
# This mounts the first DOS partition on the first WD drive, and
#  advertises it (via namer) as the root filesystem for the system.

# A VSTa filesystem as root
# Use this only if you have previously set up a vstafs filesystem.
# module= /vsta/boot/vstafs //disk/wd:wd0_bfs0 fs/root

# The only program not a server in this file
module= /vsta/boot/init
# This reads the /vsta/etc/inittab and fires off most of the usual cruft
#  needed to boot.

#
# For booting a freshly built VSTa
#
title=          VSTa debug
root=           (hd0,0)
kernel=         /vsta/src/os/make/vsta
#
# These are commented in the "VSTa boot" section above, and should be
#  identical to what you selected there.  You may, of course, edit
#  the paths to point at newly built modules in their vsta/src/...
#  location.
#
module= /vsta/boot/cons
module= /vsta/boot/namer
module= /vsta/boot/wd d0:readp
