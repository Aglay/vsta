This is the release info for the 3c509 driver for VSTa.
Version 0.1 (20010203)


This is a driver for the 3Com Etherlink III (3c509) series of network cards.
Altough it should work with all revisions and all kind of interfaces (tp, bnc,
aui), it has only been tested with a 3c509b with TP connection.
Much of the code is borrowed from the linux 3c509 driver. I didn't have a
hardware programming manual for the board so that was the only way. Other
snippits are from the VSTa ne2000 driver.

Also included is a small program to send/recieve raw ethernet frames. I used it
during the debugging. Maybe someone else will find it useful (not likely =)).
It's in ethsak.c. Compile as usual or something.

The driver tries to autodetect the io/irq, and i think it'll always succeed,
but if it wont, you are pretty much toasted. You could probably try to hardcode
in the correct io/irq, but no guarantees =).

We who made this driver are:
Kristoffer Brånemyr (ztion@swipnet.se) (Coding)
Erik Dalen (erik@jpl.nu) (Guidance to the VSTa interiours and moral support)

We are both members of ACG (Amiga Computer Group).

Things to do:
	Very badly commented...
	May not be very optimized

Otherwise it seems to function pretty well.
