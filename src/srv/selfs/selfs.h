/*
 * selfs.h
 *	Data structures in selfsphore filesystem
 *
 * selfs is a virtual filesystem supporting the select() "system call" (which,
 * of course, is nothing of the sort in VSTa).  Clients and servers connect
 * to this server (in addition to, as always, connecting to each other for
 * purposes of I/O).  When a client wishes to block waiting for some set of
 * events, it enumerates across each server, sending it a FS_WSTAT which
 * indicates the select server to use, along with parameters so that its
 * context can be indicated on that select server.
 *
 * A filesystem which does not support select will simply not recognize this
 * FS_WSTAT type, and will return an error.
 *
 * Filesystems which do will then connect to this select server (or reuse
 * an existing cached connection).  As indicated select events occur, a
 * normal FS_WRITE to the select server will indicate the availability
 * of data.  The select server then handles the other side of this, deciding
 * when to wake clients.
 *
 * On the client side, after the client has FS_WSTAT'ed each server (note that
 * it only has to do this once; the server's behavior continues until
 * explicitly un-requested), it posts an FS_READ to its select server.
 * The client then sleeps until the requested time interval has passed,
 * or until the select server sends back an indication of available
 * I/O.
